### Day 6
This Java program serves as an educational demonstration of input handling and data type conversions. It employs a `Scanner` to capture user input, showcasing how to convert a string input into both an integer and a double using `Integer.valueOf()` and `Double.valueOf()`, respectively. The program also illustrates converting an integer to a string using `String.valueOf()` and provides an alternative method using `Integer.toString()`. These operations collectively highlight essential techniques for interacting with user input and manipulating data types effectively within Java programming.
### Day 7
This Java program showcases fundamental mathematical operations through the Math class functions. It includes finding the maximum and minimum values of two integers using Math.max() and Math.min(), respectively. Additionally, it computes the square root of an integer using Math.sqrt(), and demonstrates Math.floor() and Math.ceil() to derive the floor and ceiling values of a floating-point number. Furthermore, the program utilizes Math.abs() to obtain the absolute value of a double. These operations collectively illustrate how to perform essential mathematical computations efficiently in Java.
### Day 8
This Java program, Day8, provides three main functionalities that interact with the user through the console. First, it determines if a number entered by the user is odd or even. Second, it finds the largest among three numbers provided by the user. Third, it checks if a given year is a leap year. The program guides the user through each functionality sequentially, prompting for input and displaying the results.
### Day 9
This Java program calculates grades based on user input using a switch statement. The user enters a numerical score, and the program outputs the corresponding grade (A, B, C, D, or F). The program uses a Scanner for input and a switch statement to determine the grade. It demonstrates basic control flow and user interaction in Java.
### Day 10
This Java program demonstrates the use of different types of loops (for, while, and do-while), calculates the sum of even numbers within a range, and generates a random number divisible by both 5 and 7. The user inputs an integer, and the program performs various operations based on that input.
### Day 11
This Java program demonstrates various string manipulation techniques. The class showcases operations such as string length measurement, concatenation, comparison, case conversion, trimming, substring extraction, splitting, reversal, and searching.
### Day 12
This Java program demonstrates the use of String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer in different contexts. It highlights when to use each type based on the need to modify character sequences and the environment in which the code runs (single-threaded vs multi-threaded).
### Day 13
This Java program demonstrates how to initialize an ArrayList, add elements to it, and retrieve items. It showcases basic operations on an ArrayList, including adding, accessing, and iterating over elements
### Day 14
This Java program provides functionality for handling 2D arrays, including finding the maximum values in each row and column, and transforming (transposing) the array. The main class contains methods to perform these tasks and demonstrate their usage through a series of print statements.
### Day 15
This Java program demonstrates various operations on an ArrayList of strings representing the days of the week. It includes functionalities such as printing elements, removing elements based on user input, and sorting the elements alphabetically both in ascending and descending order.
### Day 16
This java program demonstrates the use of an enum in Java. It defines an enum named weekdays containing the days of the week from Monday to Sunday, and prints all the elements in the enum.
### Day 17
This Java program demonstrates various date and time operations, including formatting dates, calculating past dates, comparing dates, and displaying current dates in different time zones.
### Day 18
This Java program performs two main functions: it counts the number of vowels in a given sentence and checks if a given number is a prime number.
### Day 19
This java program focuses on generating random numbers in Java. It includes two programs: one for generating a simple random number and another for generating a random number between two specified integers.
### Day 20
This java program demonstrates basic operations on a Set of String values in Java. It covers initializing a set, adding items, checking for existence of an item, removing items, printing the size, looping through the set to print all values, and clearing the set.
### Day 21
This java program focuses on using a HashMap to manage student data. The program initializes a HashMap to store roll numbers and student names, adds items to it, retrieves and prints student names, checks for the existence of keys, removes items, and prints the size of the HashMap. It also demonstrates iterating over the HashMap using both keySet() and entrySet().
### Day 22
This java program provides a demonstration of basic operations on a Stack in Java using the java.util.Stack class. The example includes adding elements to the stack, removing the top element, peeking at the top element, checking for the existence of an element, and clearing the stack.
### Day 23
This Java program demonstrates basic operations on a Queue using a LinkedList. The operations include adding elements, removing the head element, peeking at the head element, checking for the existence of an element, printing the size of the queue, and removing all elements from the queue.
### Day 24
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to design and develop applications. It allows developers to create modular, reusable, and maintainable code. Java is a widely-used OOP language that provides features such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
### Day 25
The Day25 class is a simple Java class that models a person with several attributes including ID, first name, last name, email, city, and country. This class provides constructors, getters, and setters for each attribute, as well as an overridden toString method for representing the object as a string.
### Day 26
The Day26 class represents a person with attributes such as ID, first name, last name, email, city, and country. It provides multiple constructors to create instances of the class with different combinations of attributes and getter and setter methods to access and modify these attributes.
### Day 27
This project contains three Java classes: User, Instructor, and Student. The User class is a base class with fields such as id, firstName, lastName, email, city, and country. The Instructor and Student classes extend the User class and add additional fields specific to their roles. This demonstrates the concept of inheritance, where Instructor and Student inherit the properties and methods of the User class, while also introducing their own unique attributes and behaviors.
### Day 28
The Instructor class extends the User class and includes additional attributes and methods specific to instructors. The primary focus of this class is to demonstrate method overloading through the incrementSalary method.
### Day 29
This package provides instructions on how to add and use the getFullname() method in the Instructor class, which overrides the getFullname() method in the User class showcasing method overiding.
### Day 30
The User abstract class serves as a base class representing a general user with common attributes and methods. It is designed to be extended by concrete subclasses that will provide specific implementations of the abstract methods. This class encapsulates user-related data and provides a default implementation for some common functionalities.
### Day 31
The Day31 package contains an interface Instructor and its implementation class Details. This package demonstrates the use of interfaces in Java and how to implement them in a concrete class.
### Day 32
The package focuses on polymorphism which is a key feature of OOP that enhances flexibility and reusability in code. The provided classes (User, Student, and Instructor) illustrate how polymorphism can be implemented through method overloading and method overriding, showcasing the power and simplicity of this concept in Java.
